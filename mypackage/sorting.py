def bubble_sort(items):
    '''
        Bubble sort is one of the most basic sorting algorithm that is the simplest
         to understand. Itâ€™s basic idea is to bubble up the largest(or smallest)

         Parameters
         ----------
         items : list
             The 2nd largest and the the 3rd and so on to the end of the list. Each bubble
             up takes a full sweep through the list.

         Returns
         -------
         list
             list of elements in items in ascending order

def merge_sort(items):
    '''Return array of items, sorted in ascending order

    Merge sort works by subdividing the the list into two sub-lists, sorting them using
    Merge sort and then merging them back up.
    Parameters
    ----------
    items : list
        list of unordered numbers as the recursive call is made to subdivide each list into a sublist,
        they will eventually reach the size of 1, which is technically a sorted list.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        list of elements in items in ascending order
